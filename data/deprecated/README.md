# Deprecated Data Files

This directory contains JSON files that are **not actively used** by the application but are kept for reference or historical purposes.

## Files in this Directory

### `academic_programs_rules_enriched.json`
- **Purpose**: Enriched version of program rules with full course metadata
- **Generated by**: `scripts/enrich_data.py`
- **Why deprecated**: This was an experimental enrichment that added full course details to program rules. The current system uses separate files (`academic_programs_rules.json` + `world_campus_courses_master.json`) for better maintainability and performance.
- **Date deprecated**: November 2025
- **Safe to delete**: Yes, but kept for reference

### `duplicate_conflicts.json`
- **Purpose**: Log file identifying courses with conflicting metadata
- **Generated by**: `scripts/generate_optimized_data.py`
- **Why deprecated**: This is a diagnostic output file generated during data optimization. It's not consumed by the application, only used for manual review during data generation.
- **Date deprecated**: November 2025
- **Safe to delete**: Yes, regenerated each time optimization script runs
